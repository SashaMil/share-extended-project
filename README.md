# Angular-Extended-Weekend-Assignement

As a capstone to your AngularJS work, you'll be making a solo project in an extended weekend fashion. 
You'll be flexing every code muscle you've built so far!
We've provided 3 projects for you to choose from. There is no code provided, save for a readme. 
You will be making everything from scratch. 

## HOMEWORK
- Read Project Options
- Pick Project
- Copy Trello Board
- Create a repo (DO NOT CLONE/FORK)

## Trello

Each Assignment contains a link to a premade Trello Board. 
Please COPY it to your own account. 
You should feel free to add or remove tasks from your own copy, but do not alter the original.
